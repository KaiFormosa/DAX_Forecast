# DAX Forecast

This is a personal project in collaboration with Sascha Witte, whom I met at Python Meetup Stuttgart. Our goal was to develop a trading algorithm and DAX Forecast was created as a pilot project. We decided to use historical data of DAX (German stock index - "*Deutscher Aktienindex*") for the project.

We started the project with building an environment for it - Sascha rented a server and created a number of Docker containers for the applications we need. CentOS was set as the operating system and Python as the programming language. I also learned to use MobaXterm and write Linux Bash commands along the way. We have already tested the data with several algorithms and are trying to improve the performance and looking for new models.
